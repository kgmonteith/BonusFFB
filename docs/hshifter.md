# H-Shifter

This application simulates an H-pattern shifter with gear grinding, locking, and [float shifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_shifting). Configuring clutch and throttle pedals axes in the `Input/output settings` tab is required. Float shifting requires [game telemetry](getting-started.md/#install-optional-telemetry-plugins).

H-Shifter is best suited to casual driving games, such truck, bus, and taxi sims. Depending on the strength of your FFB joystick, it's possible to overcome the locking, grinding, and channel-keeping force effects. Remember to play along and not push through these effects. If you want something stronger and more precise, consider a purpose-built device like the [Bash Pro](https://mvhstudios.co.uk/products/bash-pro).

## Game configuration

H-Shifter sends vJoy button presses when gears are engaged. Bind the in-game gear slots as you would with a hardware H-pattern shifter, by walking through the gears slot-by-slot in the game control settings. The input device will show up as the vJoy device you selected in H-Shifter's input/output settings.
