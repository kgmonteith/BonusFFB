# Handbrake

This mode simulates a simple handbrake lever. Controls are provided to adjust the spring strength and centering.

No active effects are simulated. Unfortunately the author has no experience with real-life racing formats that make use of a handbrake, and consequently has no idea what driving conditions would result in feedback through a handbrake. If you'd like to teach me how to drift race or rally, I'm game.

vJoy is not used for this mode, instead simply bind the device's native axis in your game settings. If for some reason a vJoy axis would be more desirable, please submit a [Github :fontawesome-brands-github: issue](https://github.com/kgmonteith/BonusFFB/issues).
