# Bonus FFB 🕹️

Do you own a force-feedback joystick? Did you know it can simulate other peripherals using only FFB effects? That's Bonus FFB!

Bonus FFB can simulate these devices using a force-feedback joystick:

* H-pattern shifters
* Sequential shifters (coming soon)
* Auto-manual shifters (eventually)

[Check out the documentation](https://kgmonteith.github.io/BonusFFB/) to get started. If you have suggestions, [open a ticket](https://github.com/kgmonteith/BonusFFB/issues).
